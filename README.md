# CaesarChatbot

This is a Julius Caesar Q&A Chatbot. Along with being able to answer common trivia questions about Caesar, it can compensate for spelling-errors and
different ways of phrasing a quesitons.

Currently requires a 3.6 python interpreter to run because tensorflow does not work very well with the latest version of python. 

A demo of the chatbot can be found on Youtube: https://youtu.be/1YRRSRFpRUk
